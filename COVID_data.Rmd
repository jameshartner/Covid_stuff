## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
install.packages('janitor')
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
covid_data <- read_csv('data/covid_data_clean.csv')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
cleaned_data_count <- covid_data %>%
  group_by(CountyReport)%>%
  summarize(
    total=sum(Number_of_Total_Cases)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  print(cleaned_data_count)
Highest_count_by_school <- covid_data %>%
  group_by(School) %>%
  summarize(
    total=sum(Number_of_Total_Cases)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  print(Highest_count_by_school)
Baltimore_county <- covid_data %>%
  filter(CountyReport =='Baltimore')
St.Marys<- covid_data %>%
  filter(CountyReport=="St. Mary's")
```
